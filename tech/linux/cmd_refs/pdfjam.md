## Printing PDF Booklets

Tested using default GNOME PDF Document Viewer (Evince v40.1)

Requirements: A Linux-compatible printer that supports double-sided printing (tested using Brother HL-2270DW)

Evince PDF print setup:

If you are printing the booklet PDF generated by pdfjam, then every other page will already be flipped vertically for double-sided printing, so you should print as follows:

* Print > Page Setup
  * Layout > Two-Sided -> Long Edge (Standard)
  * Paper > Orientation > Landscape

If you are printing a booklet PDF and the pages are not already flipped in the PDF, then you should choose "Short Edge (Flip)" to ensure that every other page is flipped vertically for double-sided printing:

* Print > Page Setup
  * Layout > Two-sided > Short Edge (Flip)
  * Paper > Orientation > Landscape

## Binding booklets
