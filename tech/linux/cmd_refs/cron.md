NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [ -u user ] file
       crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }

DESCRIPTION
       crontab  is  the  program  used  to  install,  deinstall  or  list  the  tables  used  to  drive  the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.

       If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command.  If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but  the  /etc/cron.deny
       file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command.

       If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.

       If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence.  Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab.

       Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.  For standard Debian systems, all users may use this command.

       If the -u option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be used (when listing) or modified (when editing).  If this option is not given, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e.,
       the crontab of the person executing the command.  Note that su(8) can confuse crontab and that if you are running inside of su(8) you should always use the -u option for safety's sake.

       The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ``-'' is given.

       The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output.  See the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.

       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.  After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed  au‐
       tomatically.  If neither of the environment variables is defined, then the default editor /usr/bin/editor is used.

       The -i option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before actually removing the crontab.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       The  "out-of-the-box"  behaviour for crontab -l is to display the three line "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header that is placed at the beginning of the crontab when it is installed.  The problem is that it
       makes the sequence

       crontab -l | crontab -

       non-idempotent — you keep adding copies of the header.  This causes pain to scripts that use sed to edit a crontab.  Therefore, the default behaviour of the -l option has been changed  to  not  output
       such header.  You may obtain the original behaviour by setting the environment variable CRONTAB_NOHEADER to 'N', which will cause the crontab -l command to emit the extraneous header.

SEE ALSO
       crontab(5), cron(8)

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs

       The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny if, they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group ``crontab''. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permis‐
       sions are fixed.

       There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory.  Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by  the
       system  to  run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there.  This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring
       crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command line.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character.  If the last entry in a crontab is missing the newline, cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken and refuse  to
       install it.

       The  files under /var/spool/cron/crontabs are named based on the user's account name.  Crontab jobs will not be run for users whose accounts have been renamed either due to changes in the local system
       or because they are managed through a central user database (external to the system, for example an LDAP directory).

NAME
       cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       cron [-f] [-l] [-L loglevel]

DESCRIPTION
       cron is started automatically from /etc/init.d on entering multi-user runlevels.

OPTIONS
       -f      Stay in foreground mode, don't daemonize.

       -P      Don't set PATH for child processes.  Let it inherit instead.

       -l      Enable LSB compliant names for /etc/cron.d files.  This setting, however, does not affect the parsing of files under /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly or /etc/cron.monthly.

       -n      Include the FQDN in the subject when sending mails.  By default, cron will abbreviate the hostname.

       -L loglevel
               Tell cron what to log about jobs (errors are logged regardless of this value) as the sum of the following values:

                   1      will log the start of all cron jobs

                   2      will log the end of all cron jobs

                   4      will log all failed jobs (exit status != 0)

                   8      will log the process number of all cron jobs

               The default is to log the start of all jobs (1).  Logging will be disabled if levels is set to zero (0).  A value of fifteen (15) will select all options.

NOTES
       cron  searches its spool area (/var/spool/cron/crontabs) for crontab files (which are named after accounts in /etc/passwd); crontabs found are loaded into memory.  Note that crontabs in this directory
       should not be accessed directly - the crontab command should be used to access and update them.

       cron also reads /etc/crontab, which is in a slightly different format (see crontab(5)).  In Debian, the content of /etc/crontab is predefined to run programs under  /etc/cron.hourly,  /etc/cron.daily,
       /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly.  This configuration is specific to Debian, see the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.

       Additionally,  in  Debian,  cron reads the files in the /etc/cron.d directory.  cron treats the files in /etc/cron.d as in the same way as the /etc/crontab file (they follow the special format of that
       file, i.e. they include the user field).  However, they are independent of /etc/crontab: they do not, for example, inherit environment variable settings from it.  This change is specific to Debian see
       the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.

       Like  /etc/crontab,  the  files  in  the  /etc/cron.d  directory  are  monitored  for  changes.   In  general, the system administrator should not use /etc/cron.d/, but use the standard system crontab
       /etc/crontab.

       /etc/crontab and the files in /etc/cron.d must be owned by root, and must not be group- or  other-writable.   In  contrast  to  the  spool  area,  the  files  under  /etc/cron.d  or  the  files  under
       /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly may also be symlinks, provided that both the symlink and the file it points to are owned by root.  The files under /etc/cron.d
       do not need to be executable, while the files under /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly do, as they are run by run-parts (see run-parts(8) for more information).

       cron then wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking each command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When executing commands, any output is mailed to the  owner  of
       the crontab (or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if such exists) from the owner of the crontab (or from the email address given in the MAILFROM environment variable
       in the crontab, if such exists).  The children copies of cron running these processes have their name coerced to uppercase, as will be seen in the syslog and ps output.

       Additionally, cron checks each minute to see if its spool directory's modtime (or the modtime on the /etc/crontab file) has changed, and if it has, cron will then examine the modtime on  all  crontabs
       and  reload  those  which  have  changed.  Thus cron need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.  Note that the crontab(1) command updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it
       changes a crontab.

       Special considerations exist when the clock is changed by less than 3 hours, for example at the beginning and end of daylight savings time.  If the time has moved forwards, those jobs which would have
       run in the time that was skipped will be run soon after the change.  Conversely, if the time has moved backwards by less than 3 hours, those jobs that fall into the repeated time will not be re-run.

       Only  jobs  that  run at a particular time (not specified as @hourly, nor with '*' in the hour or minute specifier) are affected.  Jobs which are specified with wildcards are run based on the new time
       immediately.

       Clock changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be corrections to the clock, and the new time is used immediately.

       cron logs its action to the syslog facility 'cron', and logging may be controlled using the standard syslogd(8) facility.

ENVIRONMENT
       If configured in /etc/default/cron in Debian systems, the cron daemon localisation settings environment can be managed through the use of /etc/environment or through  the  use  of  /etc/default/locale
       with values from the latter overriding values from the former.  These files are read and they will be used to setup the LANG, LC_ALL, and LC_CTYPE environment variables.  These variables are then used
       to set the charset of mails, which defaults to 'C'.

       This does NOT affect the environment of tasks running under cron.  For more information on how to modify the environment of tasks, consult crontab(5).

       The daemon will use, if present, the definition from /etc/timezone for the timezone.

       The environment can be redefined in user's crontab definitions but cron will only handle tasks in a single timezone.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       Debian introduces some changes to cron that were not originally available upstream.  The most significant changes introduced are:

       —      Support for /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} via /etc/crontab,

       —      Support for /etc/cron.d (drop-in dir for package crontabs),

       —      PAM support,

       —      SELinux support,

       —      auditlog support,

       —      DST and other time-related changes/fixes,

       —      SGID crontab(1) instead of SUID root,

       —      Debian-specific file locations and commands,

       —      Debian-specific configuration (/etc/default/cron),

       —      numerous other smaller features and fixes.

       Support for /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly is provided in Debian through the default setting of  the  /etc/crontab  file  (see  the  system-wide  example  in
       crontab(5)).  The default system-wide crontab contains four tasks: run every hour, every day, every week and every month.  Each of these tasks will execute run-parts providing each one of the directo‐
       ries as an argument.  These tasks are disabled if anacron is installed (except for the hourly task) to prevent conflicts between both daemons.

       As described above, the files under these directories have to pass some sanity checks including the following: be executable, be owned by root, not be writable by group  or  other  and,  if  symlinks,
       point  to  files  owned by root.  Additionally, the file names must conform to the filename requirements of run-parts: they must be entirely made up of letters, digits and can only contain the special
       signs underscores ('_') and hyphens ('-').  Any file that does not conform to these requirements will not be executed by run-parts.  For example, any file containing dots will  be  ignored.   This  is
       done  to  prevent  cron from running any of the files that are left by the Debian package management system when handling files in /etc/cron.d/ as configuration files (i.e. files ending in .dpkg-dist,
       .dpkg-orig, .dpkg-old, and .dpkg-new).

       This feature can be used by system administrators and packages to include tasks that will be run at defined intervals.  Files created by packages in these directories should be named after the package
       that supplies them.

       Support  for  /etc/cron.d  is included in the cron daemon itself, which handles this location as the system-wide crontab spool.  This directory can contain any file defining tasks following the format
       used in /etc/crontab, i.e. unlike the user cron spool, these files must provide the username to run the task as in the task definition.

       Files in this directory have to be owned by root, do not need to be executable (they are configuration files, just like /etc/crontab) and must conform to the same naming convention  as  used  by  run-
       parts(8)  : they must consist solely of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.  This means that they cannot contain any dots.  If the -l option is specified to cron (this op‐
       tion can be setup through /etc/default/cron, see below), then they must conform to the LSB namespace specification, exactly as in the --lsbsysinit option in run-parts.

       The intended purpose of this feature is to allow packages that require finer control of their scheduling  than  the  /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}  directories  to  add  a  crontab  file  to
       /etc/cron.d.  Such files should be named after the package that supplies them.

       Also,  the  default configuration of cron is controlled by /etc/default/cron which is read by the init.d script that launches the cron daemon.  This file determines whether cron will read the system's
       environment variables and makes it possible to add additional options to the cron program before it is executed, either to configure its logging or  to  define  how  it  will  treat  the  files  under
       /etc/cron.d.
